# AngularJS Auth Inspector

## Quick Start

Visit http://ngworkshop.github.io/auth-inspector/src/ and play online with the different authentication providers like Google, Facebook, etc. Auth Inspector includes lots of comments that should help you get started with the authentication provider of your choice.

## More Info

For more information like how to install Auth Inspector locally or how to use a specific authentication provider, please visit http://ngworkshop.github.io/auth-inspector/src/.

I also encourage you to browse the code in the Github repository to see how authentication and authorization were implemented for specific providers. The [src/app/auth_providers](https://github.com/ngworkshop/auth-inspector/tree/gh-pages/src/app/auth_providers) folder might be of particular interest.
